"He is called Necron99, he is one of Blackwolfe's assassins, he travels the
land destroying the believers of magic."

This PPM is based on Ralph Bakshi's movie 'Wizards', Necron99 is a badass
robot assassin who unfortunately becomes a good guy & is renamed PEACE ..
well, that's a wussy name so I'm stickin with Necron99 for the PPM =)

Modeling and animation were done with Animation: Master v6.1, a great prog
which can be bought for less than $200.  ( http://www.hash.com )

Sounds: I ripped a few death sounds from the movie, but if any1 wants to put
together a full sound pack be my guest.

Vweaps: Don't really have the time to put together Vweaps for this guy.
