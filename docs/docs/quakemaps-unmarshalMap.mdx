`unmarshalMap` parses the `.map` file and creates a series of
[`EntitySketch`](quakemaps-EntitySketch.type.mdx) objects which can be further
handled by your game logic.

It does not produce a BSP tree (which may be an advantage or a disadvantage,
dpeneding on how you look at it), instead each entity sketch contains entity
properties and a collection of brushes that are included in the entity.

You can find more info on what an entity can be and what it may contain here:
https://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qkspec_2.htm#CMFMF

Usually it's a collection of custom properties, `classname` and a series of
brushes that are used to create underlying meshes or just a set of properties
with no meshes, that need to be handled by your domain logic.
