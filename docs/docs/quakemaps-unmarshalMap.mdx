```typescript title="import path"
import { unmarshalMap } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/unmarshalMap";
```

`unmarshalMap` parses the `.map` file and creates a series of
[`EntitySketch`](quakemaps-EntitySketch.type.mdx) objects which can be further
handled by your game logic.

It does not produce a BSP tree (which may be an advantage or a disadvantage,
dpeneding on how you look at it), instead each entity sketch contains entity
properties and a collection of brushes that are included in the entity.

You can find more info on what an entity can be and what it may contain here:
https://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qkspec_2.htm#CMFMF

Usually it's a collection of custom properties, `classname` and a series of
brushes that are used to create underlying meshes or just a set of properties
with no meshes, that need to be handled by your domain logic.

## Type

```typescript
type UnmarshalMap = (
  filename: string,
  contents: string,
  resolveUrl: (textureName: string) => string,
) => Generator<EntitySketch>;
```

## Example

### Basic usage

```typescript
import { unmarshalMap } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/unmarshalMap";

const filename: string = "http://example/mymap.map";
const contents = await fetch(filename).then(response => response.text());

// Trenchbroom stores just a generic texture name in the .map file (without
// extension and path). Those need to be translated to the actual assets paths.
function resolveTextureUrl(textureName: string): string {
  return `https://my-cdn/assets/${textureName}.png`;
}

for (let entitySketch of unmarshalMap(filename, contents, resolveTextureUrl)) {
  // `entitySketch` contains raw brushes data (half-spaces collection) and
  // entity properties directly forwarded from Trenchbroom (or any other map
  // editor), like: `entitySketch.properties.classname` or
  // `entitySketch.properties.origin`.
}
```

### Creating geometries

You can use [`buildGeometryAttributes`](quakemaps-buildGeometryAttributes.mdx)
helper to handle geometries. It takes a list of brushes as an argument and
returns a list of geoemtry attributes from which you can build your geometry.

```typescript
import { BufferGeometry } from "three/src/core/BufferGeometry";
import { BufferAttribute } from "three/src/core/BufferAttribute";

import { buildGeometryAttributes } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/buildGeometryAttributes";

import type { Geometry } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/Geometry.type";

// See "Basic usage" example on how to obtain the entity sketch.
// `resolveTextureDimensions` is a function that returns the actual texture
// dimensions for the UV mapping. It also supports atlases.
const geometryAttributes: Geometry = buildGeometryAttributes(entitySketch.brushes, resolveTextureDimensions);

const geometry = new BufferGeometry();

geometry.setAttribute("normal", new BufferAttribute(geometryAttributes.normal, 3));
geometry.setAttribute("position", new BufferAttribute(geometryAttributes.position, 3));
geometry.setAttribute("uv", new BufferAttribute(geometryAttributes.uv, 2));

// Geometry is also indexed out of the box.
geometry.setIndex(geometryAttributes.index);
```

### Merging geometries

If you want, you can merge multiple map entities into a bigger one. You can
also merge all of them if you want.

```typescript
import { BufferGeometry } from "three/src/core/BufferGeometry";
import { BufferAttribute } from "three/src/core/BufferAttribute";

import { buildGeometryAttributes } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/buildGeometryAttributes";
import { unmarshalMap } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/unmarshalMap";

import type { Brush } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/Brush.type";
import type { Geometry } from "@personalidol/quakemaps/src/Geometry.type";

const filename: string = "http://example/mymap.map";
const contents = await fetch(filename).then(response => response.text());

const allBrushes: Array<Brush> = [];

for (let entitySketch of unmarshalMap(filename, contents, resolveTextureUrl)) {
  allBrushes.push(...entitySketch.brushes);
}

// Combines all map brushes into one geometry.
const geometryAttributes: Geometry = buildGeometryAttributes(allBrushes, resolveTextureDimensions);
```
