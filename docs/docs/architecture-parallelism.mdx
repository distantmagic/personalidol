JavaScript at its core is an asynchronous language, but it does not allow real
parallel execution unless you are using worker threads. I find this a really
good solution that allows to handle UI events without worrying about thread
safety and other similar concerns.

## Workers

The problem arises when the application needs to compute something heavy, that
is able to block the main thread. There are a lot of such tasks to handle when
developing a 3D environment project, especially loading 3D models, decoding
audio or loading other types of assets. It is also a good idea to use offscreen
canvas (although it has its own quirks) to render WebGL in the separate thread
from the DOM rendering thread.

This project starts with several workers to offload operations that may block
the main thread:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
      <th scope="col">Fallback</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Loader(Atlas)</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          Combines several textures into one bigger texture atlas to be used
          later with world geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communicatest with <code>Loader(Texture)</code> and <code>Worker(Progress)</code>.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Falls back to the main thread if there is no support for <a href="https://caniuse.com/offscreencanvas"><code>OffscreenCanvas</code></a> as
          it is used to combine textures.
