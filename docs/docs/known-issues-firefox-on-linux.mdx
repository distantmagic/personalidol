To keep it short, support for WebGL in Firefox on Linux is not perfect (on
Windows or Mac its fine) and it has not been addressed for years at the time of
writing:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1010527

The biggest issue is that FPS is capped at 60 no matter what your display
refresh rate is (there is no VSYNC on web anyway, but at least most WebGL
browser implentations keep up with the refresh rate) and even with this cap, it
has about 10 times less performance than WebKit. It is normal for me to see 144
FPS on Chrome/Linux and 20 FPS on Firefox/Linux and this is purely the Firefox
issue.

According to the Firefox bugtracker it is related to X11 and be resolved when
Wayland arrives.

I wish Firefox the best, but my understanding is that there is no workaround
for this and the issue won't be addressed with X11, so If you want to enjoy
WebGL on Linux either wait for Wayland to arrive or just use Chrome in the
meantime.
