:::note
This is a class and needs to be instantiated with a `new` keyword.
This is an exception to the rule here. See:
[Class-free object oriented programming](architecture-class-free.mdx).
:::

:::caution
Internally by default it uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) just to render
HTML elements, but behold! It behaves much differently than a Preact component.
Please read the this page carefully before using `DOMElementView`.
:::

`DOMElementView` extends
[`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)
and by detault opens a
[`ShadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot).

It is highly recommended to not use this class on its own, but to always use it
with [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) instead.

        <p>
          Normally, Preact components are updated when state, props or context
          changes, but <code>DOMElementView</code> is not a Preact component,
          it only uses it for rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, <code>DOMElementView</code> checks every frame if it needs
          to render. This is like so, because it makes it much easier to
          synchronize the DOM state with WebGL scene state.

## Generics

### `U`: extends [`UserSettings`](framework-UserSettings.mdx)

## Constructor

:::caution
`DOMElementView` extends `HTMLElement` and as such it can't use constructor
arguments. If you are not using
[`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx), you have to set
desired properties before using the object.
:::

```typescript
import { DOMElementView } from "@personalidol/dom-renderer/DOMElementView";

const domElementView = new DOMElementView();
```

## Properties

### `.css`: string

Set this property to the desired css limited in scope to the
[`ShadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot).
If [constructable stylesheets](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_cssstylesheet_replacesync)
are supported, they will be used to share styles between multiple instances of
the component. Otherwise, CSS will be inlined in the `<style />` tag.

### `.dimensionsState`: Uint32Array

Set this to the [`DimensionsState`](framework-DimensionsState.mdx) array before
using the object if you need it.

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.domMessagePort`: MessagePort

Set this to the
[`MessagePort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort)
that is connected to the [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx)
if you want to render other DOM views using the
[portal pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.i18next`: i18n

Set this to the [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) instance if you want to
use translations.

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.keyboardState`: Uint8Array

Set this to the [`KeyboardState`](framework-KeyboardState.mdx) array before
using the object if you need it.

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.mouseState`: Int32Array

Set this to the [`MouseState`](framework-MouseState.mdx) array before
using the object if you need it.

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.touchState`: Int32Array

Set this to the [`TouchState`](framework-TouchState.mdx) array before
using the object if you need it.

If you are using [`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) it sets
this property for you when object is connected to the DOM.

### `.lastRenderedLanguage`: string

Stores the information about the last rendered language that is currently
in the DOM. You can use it to display the current language. It is also
used to check if language changed since the last render, so you should
not write to this property yourself unless you know what you are doing.

### `.needsRender`: boolean

You need to set this property to `true` if you want to write the changes
to DOM upon the next animation tick. Without setting this to `true`,
`.render()` method won't be called. It's not just the optimization, this field
is *required* to be `true` in order to render anything.

Changing user settings or user language changes this property to `true`
automatically, so you don't have to check for settings or language changes.

After rendering, it is changed back to `false`, so each time you want an
update, you have to set it to `true`. Good place to do so and perform
additional checks to determine if you want a render is either
`.beforeRender()` method, which is here primarily just for this purpose, or
inside a property / attribute setter.

### `.uiMessagePort`: MessagePort

This
[`MessagePort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort)
can be used to notify the UIStateController about the desired state of the UI.
It is better to use the UI state instead of directly render other components
via `.domMessagePort`, but the possibility is still there.

### `.userSettings`: U

Current user settings.

### `.version`: number

This property is bumped by 1 by
[`DOMUIController`](dom-renderer-DOMUIController.mdx) each time it sets a new
properties batch. This is done for optimization, to not have to compare all
properties each time component needs to check if it needs to be rendered.

## Methods

### `.beforeRender()`: `void`

This method is called on each tick to perform additional check to see if a
render is required.

### `.render()`: `null` | `VNode<any>`

This method returns JSX VNode that is going to be written to DOM.

### `.t()`: `void`

This is a wrapper around [`i18next.t`](https://www.i18next.com/) function, but
it's bound to the i18n context.
