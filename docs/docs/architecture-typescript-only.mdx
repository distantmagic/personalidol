Most libraries (all besides `quakemaps`) are not transpiled into JavaScript
before publishing.

It is like so to make a full use of TypeScript features:

- It is easier to distinguish between class and multiple interfaces it may
  implement.
- You can use any build tool you want to utilize TypeScript in a way you wany.
  I am using [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/), because it is quick and
  reliable. You can use the default `tsc` compiler instead.
- You can easily set the target you want and preserve all source maps.
- There are no additional types to download as a dependency.
- No only interfaces are typechecked, but also internal implementation of
  imported modules is typechecked. Interfaces may not always catch all type
  edge cases that are handled by the internal methods.

With compiling TypeScript to JavaSript what happens is, you need to maintain
or use two separate codebases linked by autogenerated interfaces, which may
(and will) lead to inconsistencies between them and some type problems that
are not caught during the compile time.

I think that TypeScript is really common now and provides something that
JavaScript itself likely won't provide ever (types, generics, interfaces).
I think it was better to bet on one thing and stick to it and this is what I
did with this project.
