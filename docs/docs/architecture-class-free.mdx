## Why are there no classes?

In short the project is avoiding inheritance to promote composition.

I know that this one may sound like a heresy (not using classes) to a lot of
programmers, so I'll try to elaborate more on the topic.

Also I am a 30+ year old boomer, so I'll use a dead meme.

### Benefits of going class-free

```typescript title="Sample constructor"
import type { Interface } from "./Interface";

export function Constructor(): Interface {
  const property: string = "foo";

  function method(): void {
    // ...
  }

  return Object.freeze({
    property: property,

    method: method,
  });
}
```

By nature class-free approach pretty much enforces the single responsibility
principle and out of the box makes many anti-patterns difficult or just impossible
to implement (notably:
[god object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object) - you can't extend class
indefinitely, you really have to create a new object that relies on the other
object state;
[object orgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_orgy) - you can't
access object internals by design;
[circle-ellipse problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle%E2%80%93ellipse_problem) -
there is no polymorphism).
On the other hand you don't have to worry about most SOLID principles (notably
[openâ€“closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
as it is just enforced by the language when using this approach).

The lack of polymorphism allows to code faster and in a less
[defensive manner](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/defensive-programming/)
(you do not have to defend against internal logic changes or possible
inconsitencies, only against improper external use). You can be sure your
object internals won't be extended and messed up.

Even now, internally JS classess are really functions with prototypal
inheritance chain. On one hand, yes it conserves memory, but a) it's a micro
optimization (I'd be surprised if you could save even a megabyte of JS heap size
thanks to this; also it's a 3D app framework, so it won't run on your ZX
Spectrum anyway ;) ), and b) in the end what you are doing is you are creating an
object tied closely to every other class instance, which introduces some
possible code integrity problems on runtime (makes it prone to monkey patching
and other similar techniques). When you are making a game and want bot
protection (or you are making something else that requires a bit more of
security), then it is easier to control the surface area.

You also do not have to deal with `this` variable scope, but it's a minor
inconenience / improvement anyway.

### Staying reasonable

Unfortunately, it was not possible to apply this principle when working with
external APIs that force the use of classes. Luckily, currently inheritance
is used only with DOM custom elements as I think it would be better to just
expose the entire [custom elements API](dom-renderer-DOMElementView.mdx)
instead of creating some artificial class-free wrapper around them.

Also, yes it is possible to achieve the same thing with classes (as well as
with hundreds of different approaches), but if it is the easiest and most
convenient way to solve problems that this project is trying to solve, then
why bother? For me it's the entire point of software architecture, pick
something best among a myriad of possibilities, stick to it and go solving real
problems.

### Learning more

I highly recommend diving into Douglas Crockford works and lectures. I followed
the similar approach in this project. When I tried it I was surprised how many
common issues it resolves and how much easier it is to code that way.
